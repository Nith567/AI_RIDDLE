# AI-Riddle-Quest on Arbitrum Sepolia

AI-RIDDLE-QUEST is a decentralized application (dApp) that leverages the power of an OnChain AI(Llama3 8B) to create logic-based riddles and competitions. Participants can solve riddles, submit their answers, and win prizes if their answers meet the required score criteria. The smart contract handles validation and prize distribution, ensuring transparency and fairness.
